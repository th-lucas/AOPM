#### How to use the graph

This scatter plot has several custom features:

- When you hover over a circle, it gets bigger and a tooltip displays the name of the artist and his number of songs in the top and his number of years of presence in the Billboard Hot 100.
  
- When a circle has a red outline, it means that two (or more) artists have the same characteristics i.e. same number of songs and same number of years of presence in the Billboard Hot 100 (year end). 
  
  Jittering has been used to display the different circles when they have the same coordinates.
  
- You can click on an artist's circle to have more details about this singer or band. A table will show up below the graph with the name, release year and rank of all the tracks ranked in the Billboard Hot 100 for this particular artist. You can also play a preview of the track (30 seconds).
  
- Using the buttons on the top right corner of the graph you can choose how many artists you want to display on the graph.
